# 1 === Theoretical info about the project ===
This project is called Langyboost and its purpose is to build a useful, yet simple, language learning application. As I'm a huge fan of German language it will be the first supported one. 

Application is currently under development stage and missing most of the desired features. In the end there will be multiple courses available, each having sections of phrases. (containing new words to learn) 

I have been studying 3 languages so far and I believe this is the most efficient way to improve. (besides living in the foreign country of the target language) In short there will be phrases available for practise and each showing in intervals of days/weeks depending how well the user remembered them.

I was inspired by many language learning applications but mostly by Memrise, where I disliked the long proccess of repetion of voice/writting inputs.
