# Created by the author - development stuff

## to automatically generate types from scss run - 
npx typed-scss-modules src --watch

## to generate types for graphql 
npm run gen 
-> graphql-codegen --config codegen.yml 
-> searches in http://localhost:4000/graphql so BE needs to be running on that address





## additional info
images can be found inside on src/images but particles could be loaded only from within public/particles -> having two folders for images
