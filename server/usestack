1. Node.js with Express:
Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It's a great choice for building RESTful APIs.
2. Prisma:
As you mentioned, Prisma is an excellent ORM for interacting with your PostgreSQL database. It provides type-safe database access and integrates well with TypeScript.
3. TypeScript:
Using TypeScript with Node.js and Prisma will help enforce types across your backend, providing better tooling and reducing runtime errors.
Swagger/OpenAPI:
Swagger (now part of the OpenAPI Initiative) is a powerful tool for designing, building, and documenting RESTful APIs. You can use tools like Swagger UI and Swagger Editor to create and visualize your API documentation.
OpenAPI Generator can be used to generate client libraries, server stubs, and API documentation from an OpenAPI Specification.
Zod or Joi:
For runtime validation and type inference, you can use libraries like Zod or Joi. These can help ensure that the data being passed to your API endpoints is valid and conforms to expected types.
6. PostgreSQL:
As your database, PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system with a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.
Docker:
Consider using Docker to containerize your application and database, making it easier to manage dependencies and deploy your application consistently across different environments.
Testing Frameworks:
Use testing frameworks like Jest or Mocha for unit and integration testing to ensure your API behaves as expected.
9. Authentication and Authorization:
Implement authentication and authorization using libraries like Passport.js or Auth0 for secure access control.
Here's a high-level overview of how these technologies can work together:
Express will handle incoming HTTP requests and route them to the appropriate handlers.
Prisma will be used within these handlers to interact with your PostgreSQL database.
TypeScript will provide type safety across your codebase.
Swagger/OpenAPI will be used to document your API and generate client libraries if needed.
Zod/Joi will validate incoming request data.
Docker can be used to run your application and database in containers for easy deployment.
This stack provides a solid foundation for building a type-safe, scalable, and well-documented REST API.
